Just Import the DB and have fun with it :)


PS' I'm looking for a backend developer to use the database and help me build a website that provides
valuable information to the students about their grades and what it really means and their position
between their colleagues.
If you are interested contact me ASAP on: jo.adam.93@gmail.com


How it's done:
-----------------------------------------------------

It's done in 2 steps:
1_ get all the html files for students result 'Results HTML.py'
2_ parse those HTML file to generate the DB 'Gen DB.py'


About the database:
------------------------------------------------------

[The Database can be found at the Database directory]

It consists of 3 tables (Students, Courses, Courses_info)

-Students table (student_id [varchar], student_name [varchar], student_grade[float])

-Courses table (course_id[int], student_id[varchar])

    *multiple entries for the same course_id and for the same student_id

-Courses_info table (course_id, course_name, course_average[float], course_max[float], course_min[float])



The code isn't that fancy, and you can use the Database directly to your benefit.
Just be nice and let us know about it.

[Works For Fall 2014 semester]
I expect this to work for each and every semester, but some parameters will be updated,
I will update the code each semester, If I didn't you are welcome to edit it and make a pull request.



About ASU CHEP ID:
-------------------------------------------------------

It consists of 3 parts, for example for my ID '11p6001':
    [11]  [p6]  [001]

11: is the class number for all students who applied in the same year as me
    it increments every year, the first year being [04] and the last one as of spring 2015 '14'

 p6: this is for the department, the departments are from [p1] > [p8] '8 departments'

 001: just a sequentially generated number: for my class and department we are 23 students it's
      001 > 023
